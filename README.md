# JinjaSnap
Asset bundling for Jinja templates

## Usage
JinjaSnap introduces the `{% bundle %}` tag, which takes up to two arguments:
1. _src (required)_: The asset file to be bundled.
1. _dst_: The location to write the bundle to.

## Contributing
This project is not yet ready to accept contributions. Please watch the project if you're interested. I'll open it up once I've laid down the necessary boilerplate.
